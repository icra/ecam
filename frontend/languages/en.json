"#The Climate-Carbon Feedback (CCF) refers to the effect that a changing climate has on the carbon cycle, which impacts atmospheric CO2 and turn changes the climate further. In concrete terms: when CO2 is emitted, the atmospheric CO2 pool increases. A fraction of this excess atmospheric CO2 is taken up by the ocean and the terrestrial biosphere (the “carbon sinks”), but as long as a part of the excess CO2 stays in the atmosphere, it warms the climate. In turn, this warming climate slows down the uptake of the atmospheric CO2 by the sinks. This slowing-down constitutes a positive feedback – i.e. a warming climate is warmed further through the feedback.":"The Climate-Carbon Feedback (CCF) refers to the effect that a changing climate has on the carbon cycle, which impacts atmospheric CO2 and turn changes the climate further.

"#The Global Warming Potential (GWP) allows comparisons of the global warming impacts of different gases. It is a measure of how much energy the emissions of 1 ton of a gas will be absorbed over a given period of time. The foundation of this is the potential of carbon dioxide to absorb heat, which is standardized to the value “1”, whereas the other gases are compared to carbon dioxide. The larger the GWP, the more the gas warms the Earth compared to CO2 over that time period. The IPCC will update the GWP values they use according to updated scientific estimates of the energy absorption or lifetime of the gases.":"The Global Warming Potential (GWP) allows comparisons of the global warming impacts of different gases.
