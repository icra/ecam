CHANGES FROM v3.0.0 TO v3.0.1
-----------------------------

The following emissions are calculated but not accounted in the total GHG
emissions.

CO2 emissions generated during flaring or combustion (CH4 to CO2) are of
biogenic origin and hence are not accounted in the total GHG emissions.

1. biogas flared emissions

wwt_KPI_GHG_biog_flared (Sanitation Treatment)
wwo_KPI_GHG_biog_flared (Onsite Treatment)

2. biogas valorized emissions

wwt_KPI_GHG_biog_valorized (Sanitation Treatment)
wwo_KPI_GHG_biog_valorized (Onsite Treatment)
